# Java DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

## Overview

This repository contains structured implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms in Java**, designed to strengthen core computer science fundamentals through hands-on problem solving.  
It serves as a learning and reference repository for interview preparation, academic understanding, and competitive programming.

The focus of this project is **clarity, correctness, and algorithmic thinking**, rather than framework-heavy or production-oriented code.

## Key Features

### Data Structures

- Arrays and basic array operations  
- Linked Lists (Singly / Doubly)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Hashing concepts
- Heaps / Priority Queues
- Graph representations (Adjacency List based)

### Algorithms

- Searching algorithms (Linear, Binary)
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- Recursion and backtracking problems
- Tree traversals (DFS, BFS)
- Graph traversal algorithms
- Pattern-based and logic-building problems

## Core Concepts Used

- Time and Space Complexity Analysis
- Recursion and Divide & Conquer
- Iterative vs Recursive approaches
- Problem decomposition
- Algorithm optimization techniques

---

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or terminal

### Running a File

```bash
javac src/filename.java
java -cp src filename
````

Or simply run the files directly from your IDE.

## Coding Approach

* Clean and readable Java code
* Descriptive variable and method names
* Comments for complex logic
* Focus on understanding over premature optimization

---

## Limitations

* No persistence or database integration
* No unit testing or CI setup
* Single-user, local execution only

These limitations are intentional to keep the focus on **DSA fundamentals**.

---

## Motivation

This repository was created to:

* Build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms
* Prepare for technical interviews and coding assessments
* Practice problem-solving using Java
* Maintain a well-organized personal DSA reference
